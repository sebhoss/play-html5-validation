h1. HTML5 Validation

p. The HTML5 validation module provides a drop-in replacement for HTML @<input>@ elements called @#{input /}@  which automatically adds HTML5 validation attributes to the final output based on your Play! model validation annotations.

h2. Example

p. Suppose you have a Model class called @User@ which has a field called @name@ declared as


bq. @Required
@MaxSize(8)
@Match("[a-z]*")
public String name;

p. you can replace your existing @<input>@ element with the following:

pre. #{input for:'user.name', id:'YourID', class:'class1 class2' /}

The tag will then output the following HTML code:

pre. <input name="user.name" value="${user?.name}" id="YourID" class="class1 class2" required maxlength="8" pattern="[a-z]*">
